# Java-Projects
Hi there! This is a repository of some of my favorite Java projects I've done in class.

Here's a quick summary of the three projects:

1) **Huffman**: This is the implementation of the main Huffman program. 
This class takes a file and compresses its data using binary digits so that it can occupy less space.

2) **QuestionGame**: Twenty Questions is a guessing game in which one player chooses a secret object and the other player
asks yes/no questions to try to idenfity the chosen object. In this version, the human will be the chooser
and begin a round by choosing an object. The computer will be the guesser and attempt to guess that
object by asking a series of yes/no questions until it thinks it knows the answer. Then, the computer
makes a guess; if its guess is correct, the computer wins, and otherwise the human player wins. If the
computer loses, it will add the chosen object to its knowledge base so it will be able to guess it the next
time it plays.

3) **EvilHangman**: This is a game of HAngman but with a twist! In this EVIL game of hangman, the 
computer delays picking a specific secret word until it is forced to do so.
As a result, the computer is always considering a set of
words that could be the secret word. In order to fool
the user into thinking it is playing fairly, the computer
only considers words with the same letter pattern.
